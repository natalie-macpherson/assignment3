        <p>For my design, I wanted to keep it light with a spring feel to it. The colours are the current colours that are being used in clothing designs for the 2014 spring season. Fur- thermore, I wanted to use the co- lours from my palette to design the social media icons and accents co- lours throughout the website. For my background in my header, I used Japanese paper because it maintains the light feminine feel that is reflective of the brand. For my fonts, I decide to go with Open Sans for etc... and Libre Baskerville for the. The brand caters to fashions that women can wear in all aspects of their life from special occasions to the causal weekender. In the design for my logo, I created an A that looking like sewing thread in order to re- flect the quality of the clothing made my the brand. For the logo’s name I used Buenard to reflect the angles of the icon.</p>
